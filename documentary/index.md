%NPM: typal%

`typal` Keeps Types In XML files And Converts Them To (1) JavaScript JSDoc, (2) Closure Externs and (3) Markdown Documentation. It is the alternative to TypeScript definitions and utilises the power of JSDoc for excellent developer experience, documentation readability and compiler annotation. It also makes integration between _Google Closure Compiler_ and _VSCode_ easy, using the JSDoc notations that are understood by both at the same time.

```sh
yarn add -E typal
```
