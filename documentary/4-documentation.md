## Markdown Documentation

_Typal_ allows to paste types into documentation using the [_Documentary_](http://artdecocode.com/documentary/) package. It will also link the types it knows about for easier navigation. The supported types are based on the [Google Closure Compiler types](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/wiki/Types-in-the-Closure-Type-System#optional) and include the following:

<typedef narrow>example/md.xml</typedef>

[Used source types](example/md.xml).
