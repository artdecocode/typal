## Showcase

This is an example of the source code JSDoc annotations automatically generated by _Typal_.

<Code src="example/restream/compat.js" />

The types declarations are taken from the `types.xml` file:

<Code src="example/restream/types2.xml" />

And the externs that are generated for the _Google Closure Compiler_ will take the following format:

<Code src="example/restream/externs.js" />
